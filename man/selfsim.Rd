\arguments{
\item{m}{input matrix such as a spectrogram}

\item{norm}{if TRUE, each FFT frame is normalized by max power}

\item{simil}{method for comparing frames: "cosine" = cosine similarity, "cor"
= Pearson's correlation}

\item{win}{the length of window for averaging self-similarity, frames}
}
\value{
Returns a square self-similarity matrix.
