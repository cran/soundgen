\title{Random walk}
\usage{
getRandomWalk(len, rw_range = 1, rw_smoothing = 0.2, method = c("linear",
  "spline")[2], trend = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{len}{an integer specifying the required length of random walk. If len
is 1, returns a single draw from a gamma distribution with mean=1 and
sd=rw_range}

\item{rw_range}{the upper bound of the generated random walk (the lower bound
is set to 0)}

\item{rw_smoothing}{specifies the amount of smoothing, from 0 (no smoothing)
to 1 (maximum smoothing to a straight line)}

\item{method}{specifies the method of smoothing: either linear interpolation
('linear', see \code{\link[stats]{approx}}) or cubic splines ('spline', see
\code{\link[stats]{spline}})}

\item{trend}{mean of generated normal distribution (vectors are also
acceptable, as long as their length is an integer multiple of len). If
positive, the random walk has an overall upwards trend (good values are
between 0 and 0.5 or -0.5). Trend = c(1,-1) gives a roughly bell-shaped rw
with an upward and a downward curve. Larger absolute values of trend
produce less and less random behavior}
}
\value{
Returns a numeric vector of length len and range from 0 to rw_range.
}
\description{
Internal soundgen function.
}
\details{
Generates a random walk with flexible control over its range, trend, and
smoothness. It works by calling \code{\link[stats]{rnorm}} at each step and
taking a cumulative sum of the generated values. Smoothness is controlled by
initially generating a shorter random walk and upsampling.

\examples{
plot(soundgen:::getRandomWalk(len = 1000, rw_range = 5,
  rw_smoothing = .2))
plot(soundgen:::getRandomWalk(len = 1000, rw_range = 15,
  rw_smoothing = .2, trend = c(.5, -.5)))
plot(soundgen:::getRandomWalk(len = 1000, rw_range = 15,
  rw_smoothing = .2, trend = c(15, -1)))
