\title{Generate beat}
\usage{
beat(nSyl = 10, sylLen = 200, pauseLen = 50, pitchAnchors = c(200, 10),
  samplingRate = 16000, fadeOut = TRUE, play = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{nSyl}{the number of syllables to generate}

\item{sylLen}{average duration of each syllable, ms}

\item{pauseLen}{average duration of pauses between syllables, ms}

\item{pitchAnchors}{a numeric vector of f0 values in Hz (assuming equal time
steps) or a dataframe specifying the time (ms or 0 to 1) and value (Hz) of
each anchor. These anchors are used to create a smooth contour of
fundamental frequency f0 (pitch) within one syllable (see Examples)}

\item{samplingRate}{sampling frequency, Hz}

\item{fadeOut}{if TRUE, a linear fade-out is applied to the entire syllable}

\item{play}{if TRUE, plays the synthesized sound. In case of errors, try
setting another default player for \code{\link[tuneR]{play}}}
}
\value{
Returns a non-normalized waveform centered at zero.
}
\description{
Generates percussive sounds from clicks through drum-like beats to sliding
tones. The principle is to create a sine wave with rapid frequency modulation
and to add a fade-out. No extra harmonics or formants are added. For this
specific purpose, this is vastly faster and easier than to tinker with
\code{\link{soundgen}} settings, especially since percussive syllables tend
to be very short.
}
\examples{
play = c(TRUE, FALSE)[2]
# a drum-like sound
s = beat(nSyl = 1, sylLen = 200,
                 pitchAnchors = c(200, 100), play = play)
plot(s, type = 'l')

# a dry, muted drum
s = beat(nSyl = 1, sylLen = 200,
                 pitchAnchors = c(200, 10), play = play)

# sci-fi laser guns
s = beat(nSyl = 3, sylLen = 300,
                 pitchAnchors = c(1000, 50), play = play)

# machine guns
s = beat(nSyl = 10, sylLen = 10, pauseLen = 50,
                 pitchAnchors = c(2300, 300), play = play)
