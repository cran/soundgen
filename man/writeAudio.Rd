\usage{
writeAudio(x, scale_used = NULL, audio, filename)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector}

\item{scale_used}{actually used scale (max(abs(x))) - overrides
audio$scale_used}

\item{audio}{list returned by \code{\link{readAudio}} containing
samplingRate, bit, scale, scale_used}

\item{filename}{full path and filename including .wav}
}
\description{
Internal soundgen function.
}
\details{
Writes a .wav file to disk based on the bit/scale/samplingRate contained in
the internally generated \code{audio} object. The point with using this
function is to package tuneR::Wave + normalize + writeWave in a
soundgen-specific way. Unlike seewave::savewav, writeAudio does NOT normalize
or rescale the input.
