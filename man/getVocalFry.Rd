\usage{
getVocalFry(rolloff, pitch_per_gc, subFreq = 100, subDep = 100,
  throwaway = -120, shortestEpoch = 300)
}
\arguments{
\item{rolloff}{matrix of original amplitudes of each harmonic in f0 stack
returned by \code{\link{getRolloff}} (columns=time, rows=frequency bins)}

\item{pitch_per_gc}{vector of the same length as ncol(rolloff)): f0 in Hz,
one value per glottal cycle}

\item{subFreq}{target frequency of subharmonics, Hz (lower than f0, adjusted
dynamically so f0 is always a multiple of subFreq)}

\item{subDep}{the width of subharmonic band, Hz. Regulates how quickly the
strength of subharmonics fades as they move away from harmonics in f0
stack. Low values produce narrow sidebands, high values produce uniformly
strong subharmonics}

\item{throwaway}{discard harmonics and noise that are quieter than this
number (in dB, defaults to -120) to save computational resources}

\item{shortestEpoch}{minimum duration of each epoch with unchanging
subharmonics regime, in ms}
}
\value{
Returns a list consisting of a list of rolloff matrices (one matrix
  per epoch) and a dataframe of epochs.
}
\description{
Internal soundgen function.
}
\details{
Adds subharmonics to the main (f0) harmonic stack, forming sidebands.

\examples{
pitch_per_gc = c(400, 500, 600, 700)
rolloff = getRolloff(pitch_per_gc, rolloff = -30)
# one epoch, two subharmonics
rolloff_subh = soundgen:::getVocalFry(rolloff, pitch_per_gc,
  subFreq = 200, subDep = 150, shortestEpoch = 100)
# three epochs with 2/3/4 subharmonics
rolloff_subh = soundgen:::getVocalFry(rolloff, pitch_per_gc,
  subFreq = 200, subDep = 150, shortestEpoch = 0)
