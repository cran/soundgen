\arguments{
\item{nr}{the number of frequency bins = windowLength_points/2, where
windowLength_points is the size of window for Fourier transform}

\item{nc}{the number of time steps for Fourier transform}

\item{formants}{a character string like "aaui" referring to default presets
for speaker "M1"; a vector of formant frequencies; or a list of formant
times, frequencies, amplitudes, and bandwidths, with a single value of each
for static or multiple values of each for moving formants. \code{formants =
NA} defaults to schwa. Time stamps for formants and mouthOpening can be
specified in ms or an any other arbitrary scale.}

\item{formantDep}{scale factor of formant amplitude (1 = no change relative
to amplitudes in \code{formants})}

\item{formantWidth}{scale factor of formant bandwidth (1 = no change)}

\item{lipRad}{the effect of lip radiation on source spectrum, dB/oct (the
default of +6 dB/oct produces a high-frequency boost when the mouth is
open)}

\item{noseRad}{the effect of radiation through the nose on source spectrum,
dB/oct (the alternative to \code{lipRad} when the mouth is closed)}

\item{mouth}{mouth opening (0 to 1, 0.5 = neutral, i.e. no
modification) (anchor format)}

\item{interpol}{the method of smoothing envelopes based on provided mouth
anchors: 'approx' = linear interpolation, 'spline' = cubic spline, 'loess'
(default) = polynomial local smoothing function. NB: this does NOT affect
the smoothing of formant anchors}

\item{mouthOpenThres}{open the lips (switch from nose radiation to lip
radiation) when the mouth is open \code{>mouthOpenThres}, 0 to 1}

\item{openMouthBoost}{amplify the voice when the mouth is open by
\code{openMouthBoost} dB}

\item{vocalTract}{the length of vocal tract, cm. Used for calculating formant
dispersion (for adding extra formants) and formant transitions as the mouth
opens and closes. If \code{NULL} or \code{NA}, the length is estimated
based on specified formant frequencies, if any (anchor format)}

\item{temperature}{hyperparameter for regulating the amount of stochasticity
in sound generation}

\item{formDrift}{scale factor regulating the effect of temperature on the
depth of random drift of all formants (user-defined and stochastic): the
higher, the more formants drift at a given temperature}

\item{formDisp}{scale factor regulating the effect of temperature on the
irregularity of the dispersion of stochastic formants: the higher, the more
unevenly stochastic formants are spaced at a given temperature}

\item{formantDepStoch}{the amplitude of additional formants added above
the highest specified formant (only if temperature > 0)}

\item{smoothLinearFactor}{regulates smoothing of formant anchors (0 to +Inf)
as they are upsampled to the number of fft steps \code{nc}. This is
necessary because the input \code{formants} normally contains fewer
sets of formant values than the number of fft steps.
\code{smoothLinearFactor} = 0: close to default spline; >3: approaches
linear extrapolation}

\item{formantCeiling}{frequency to which stochastic formants are calculated,
in multiples of the Nyquist frequency; increase up to ~10 for long vocal
tracts to avoid losing energy in the upper part of the spectrum}

\item{samplingRate}{sampling frequency, Hz}

\item{speedSound}{speed of sound in warm air, cm/s. Stevens (2000) "Acoustic
phonetics", p. 138}

\item{output}{"simple" returns just the spectral filter, while "detailed"
also returns a data.frame of formant frequencies over time (needed for
internal purposes such as formant locking)}

\item{plot}{if TRUE, produces a plot of the spectral envelope}

\item{duration}{duration of the sound, ms (for plotting purposes only)}

\item{colorTheme}{black and white ('bw'), as in seewave package ('seewave'),
or another color theme (e.g. 'heat.colors')}

\item{nCols}{number of colors in the palette}

\item{xlab, ylab}{labels of axes}

\item{...}{other graphical parameters passed on to \code{image()}}
}
\value{
Returns a spectral filter (matrix nr x nc, where nr is the number of
  frequency bins and nc is the number of time steps). Accordingly, rownames
  of the output give central frequency of each bin(in kHz), while colnames
  give time values (in ms if duration is specified, otherwise 0 to 1).
}
\description{
Prepares a spectral envelope for filtering a sound to add formants, lip
radiation, and some stochastic component regulated by temperature. Formants
are specified as a list containing time, frequency, amplitude, and width
values for each formant (see examples). See vignette('sound_generation',
package = 'soundgen') for more information.
