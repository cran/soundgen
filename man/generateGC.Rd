\title{Generate glottal cycles}
\usage{
generateGC(pitch_per_gc, glottisClosed_per_gc, rolloff_per_gc, samplingRate)
}
\arguments{
\item{pitch_per_gc}{pitch per glottal cycle, Hz}

\item{glottisClosed_per_gc}{proportion of closed phase per glottal cycle, \%}

\item{rolloff_per_gc}{a list of one-column matrices, one for each glottal
cycle, specifying rolloff per harmonic (linear multiplier, ie NOT in dB)
Each matrix has as many rows as there are harmonics, and rownames specify
the ratio to F0 (eg 1.5 means it's a subharmonic added between f0 and its
first harmonic)}

\item{samplingRate}{the sampling rate of generated sound, Hz}
}
\value{
Returns a waveform as a non-normalized numeric vector centered at zero.
}
\description{
Internal soundgen function.
Takes descriptives of a number of glottal cycles (f0, closed phase, rolloff)
and creates a waveform consisting of a string of these glottal cycles
separated by pauses (if there is a closed phase). The principle is to work
with one glottal cycle at a time and create a sine wave for each harmonic,
with amplitudes adjusted by rolloff.

\examples{
pitch_per_gc = seq(100, 150, length.out = 25)
glottisClosed_per_gc = seq(0, 300, length.out = 25)
m = matrix(10 ^ (-6 * log2(1:200) / 20))
rownames(m) = 1:nrow(m)
rolloff_source = rep(list(m), 25)
s = soundgen:::generateGC(pitch_per_gc,  glottisClosed_per_gc,
                          rolloff_source,  samplingRate = 16000)
