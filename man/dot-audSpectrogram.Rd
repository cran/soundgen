\arguments{
\item{audio}{a list returned by \code{readAudio}}

\item{step}{step, ms (determines time resolution of the plot, but not of the
returned envelopes per channel). step = NULL means no downsampling at all
(ncol of output = length of input audio)}

\item{dynamicRange}{dynamic range, dB. All values more than one dynamicRange
under maximum are treated as zero}

\item{filterType}{"butterworth" = Butterworth filter
\code{\link[signal]{butter}}, "chebyshev" = Chebyshev filter
\code{\link[signal]{butter}}, "gammatone" =
\code{\link[seewave]{gammatone}}}

\item{nFilters}{the number of filters between \code{minFreq} and
\code{maxFreq} (determines frequency resolution, while \code{yScale}
determines the location of center frequencies)}

\item{nFilters_oct}{an alternative way to specify frequency resolution: the
number of filters per octave}

\item{filterOrder}{filter order (defaults to 4 for gammatones, 3 otherwise)}

\item{bandwidth}{filter bandwidth, octaves. If NULL, defaults to ERB
bandwidths as in \code{\link[seewave]{gammatone}}}

\item{bandwidthMult}{a scaling factor for all bandwidths (1 = no effect)}

\item{minFreq, maxFreq}{the range of frequencies to analyze. If the
spectrogram looks empty, try increasing minFreq - the lowest filters are
prone to returning very large values}

\item{minBandwidth}{minimum filter bandwidth, Hz (otherwise filters may
become too narrow when nFilters is high; has no effect if filterType =
'gammatone')}

\item{output}{a list of measures to return. Defaults to everything, but this
takes a lot of RAM, so shorten to what's needed if analyzing many files at
once}

\item{plot}{should a spectrogram be plotted? TRUE / FALSE}

\item{plotFilters}{if TRUE, plots the filters as central frequencies Â±
bandwidth/2}

\item{osc}{"none" = no oscillogram; "linear" = on the original scale; "dB" =
in decibels}

\item{heights}{a vector of length two specifying the relative height of the
spectrogram and the oscillogram (including time axes labels)}

\item{ylim}{frequency range to plot, kHz (defaults to 0 to Nyquist
frequency). NB: still in kHz, even if yScale = bark, mel, or ERB}

\item{yScale}{determines the location of center frequencies of the filters}

\item{contrast}{controls the sharpness or contrast of the image: <0 =
decrease contrast, 0 = no change, >0 increase contrast. Recommended range
approximately (-1, 1). The spectrogram is raised to the power of
\code{exp(3 * contrast)}}

\item{brightness}{makes the image lighter or darker: <0 = darker, 0 = no
change, >0 = lighter, range (-1, 1). The color palette is preserved, so
"brightness" works by capping an increasing proportion of image at the
lightest or darkest color. To lighten or darken the palette, just change
the colors instead}

\item{maxPoints}{the maximum number of "pixels" in the oscillogram (if any)
and spectrogram; good for quickly plotting long audio files; defaults to
c(1e5, 5e5); does not affect reassigned spectrograms}

\item{padWithSilence}{if TRUE, pads the sound with just enough silence to
resolve the edges properly (only the original region is plotted, so the
apparent duration doesn't change)}

\item{colorTheme}{black and white ('bw'), as in seewave package ('seewave'),
matlab-type palette ('matlab'), or any palette from
\code{\link[grDevices]{palette}} such as 'heat.colors', 'cm.colors', etc}

\item{col}{actual colors, eg rev(rainbow(100)) - see ?hcl.colors for colors
in base R (overrides colorTheme)}

\item{extraContour}{a vector of arbitrary length scaled in Hz (regardless of
yScale, but nonlinear yScale also warps the contour) that will be plotted
over the spectrogram (eg pitch contour); can also be a list with extra
graphical parameters such as lwd, col, etc. (see examples)}

\item{xlab, ylab, main, mar, xaxp}{graphical parameters for plotting}

\item{grid}{if numeric, adds n = \code{grid} dotted lines per kHz}

\item{width, height, units, res}{graphical parameters for saving plots passed to
\code{\link[grDevices]{png}}}

\item{...}{other graphical parameters}
