          CHANGES IN SOUNDGEN VERSION 1.2.0 [04-March-2018]

Back-compatibible with soundgen 1.1.x. Old code will mostly produce the same results, except for moving noise formants and amplitude envelopes in polysyllabic sounds.

MAJOR:
  * soundgen(): the argument "formantsNoise" (formants in the unvoiced component) now affects polysyllabic bouts in the same way as "formants" (formants in the voiced component), i.e. moving formants in "noiseFormants" span multiple syllables (see vignette 2.12)
  * soundgen(): vectorized parameters sylLen, pauseLen, vibratoFreq, vibratoDep, jitterDep, jitterLen, and shimmerLen. For ex., "nSyl = 15, sylLen = 300:150" produces 15 progressively shorter syllables from 300 ms to 150 ms in length (see vignette 2.5)
  * soundgen(): a new argument, "nonlinRandomWalk", for specifying the exact timing of each vocal regime (0 = none, 1 = subharmonics, 2 = subharmonics + jitter + shimmer). This is intended for making reproducible examples of sounds with nonlinear effects (see vignette 2.11.5)
  * soundgen(): "amplAnchorsGlobal" adjusts the amplitude from syllable to syllable in discrete steps, instead of applying a smooth amplitude envelope to the entire bout, and it also applies to the unvoiced component (turbulent noise)
  * depends on seewave >=2.1.0 because of changes in the seewave package

NEW FUNCTIONS:
  * spectrogramFolder(): extracts and saves spectrograms of all .wav files in a folder, creates an html file with a table of click-to-play spectrograms
  * getRandomWalk(), getIntegerRandomWalk(): functions for customizing the random walks that divide the sound into segments with different nonlinear regimes; see "nonlinRandomWalk" argument to soundgen()

MINOR:
  * soundgen(): an option to add extra stochastic formants to the unvoiced component, just like for the voiced component. To do so, specify "vocalTract" explicitly (see vignette 2.12.1)
  * soundgen(): the expected range of amplAnchors is now (throwaway, 0), e.g. (-80, 0), and for amplAnchorsGlobal 0 means no change. Values on the old scale will still work (see vignette 2.8)
  * soundgen(): a negative pause (overlap) is allowed between bouts (but not between syllables)
  * soundgen(): attack can be different at the beginning and end of a syllable, e.g. "attackLen = c(50, 100)"
  * getSmoothContour(): proper handling and plotting of anchors that need downsampling, interpolation forced exactly through the specified anchors with interpol = 'approx'
  * segmentFolder(), analyzeFolder(): new argument "htmlPlots" to create an html file with a table of click-to-play plots; new default strategy for saving plots (see "savePlots" argument)
  * analyze(), analyzeFolder(), segment(), segmentFolder(): new argument "res" for proper control of the size and resolution of the output plots


          CHANGES IN SOUNDGEN VERSION 1.1.2 [23-January-2018]
NEW FUNCTIONS:
  * schwa(): estimates expected formant frequencies for a given vocal tract length, deviation of measured formants from the schwa, or formant frequencies in Hz corresponding to given deviations from the schwa
  * getEntropy(): calculates Shannon or Weiner entropy of a vector such as power spectrum

MINOR:
  * soundgen(): very rapid or instantaneous attack is now achievable without adjusting windowLength
  * soundgen(): a new top-level scaling factor formantWidth for simple control of formant bandwidth
  * soundgen(): noiseAnchors are scaled appropriately as syllable length varies due to jitter, while post-syllabic noiseAnchors are not scaled with syllable duration (i.e. the length of post-syllabic aspiration is held constant as syllable length varies)
  * soundgen(): interpol affects the smoothing of mouth anchors
  * analyze(), segment(): streamlined and extended plotting options, fixed a bug in saving plots
  * segment(): fixed a bug that caused pauseLen_sd to always return NA
  * spectrogram(): proper handling of silent or very short input
  * spectrogram(): fixed a bug in denoising routines
  * morph(): fixed a bug with noiseAnchors that are NULL in one sound and another bug caused by changes in duplicated() that were introduced in the new version of r-devel. Thanks to Kurt Hornik for pointing this out


          CHANGES IN SOUNDGEN VERSION 1.1.1 [02-December-2017]
NEW FUNCTIONS:
  * addFormants() for adding or removing formants from an existing sound
  * fade() for adding linear/logarithmic/etc fade-in/out
  * One-click formant picker tool added to soundgen_app()

MINOR:
  * soundgen(): support for discontinuous contours such as pitch jumps, new arguments to soundgen for controlling interpolation between anchors (new arguments: "interpol", "discontThres", "jumpThres")
  * soundgen(): all tempEffects default to 1 and act like scaling factors, a new tempEffect added ("specDep")
  * soundgen(): invalidArgAction propagates through temperature effects, ensuring that "weird" parameter values outside the ranges in permittedValues are processed properly
  * soundgen(): vectorized rolloffNoise
  * soundgen(): slightly modified effects of creakyBreathy hyperparameter
  * soundgen_app(): fixed a bug introduced in soundgen 1.1.0, which caused the app to crash with simplified formant specification
  * Extended and updated vignette on sound generation
  * Miscellaneous small-scale debugging


          CHANGES IN SOUNDGEN VERSION 1.1.0 [19-October-2017]

MAJOR
  * Formant generation is now compatible with standard phonetic models (all-pole or zero-pole models instead of densities of gamma distribution).
  * Unvoiced component is generated with a flat spectrum up to a certain threshold, followed by linear rolloff.
  * An alternative method of synthesizing glottal pulses one by one ("soundgen(glottisAnchors = ...)". Good for vocal fry and, potentially, for integrating alternative models of glottal pulses (future work).
  * Back-compatibility in program syntax is preserved, but presets from version 1.0.0 will sound different. The vignette on sound generation and the preset library are updated accordingly.

MINOR
  * Support for shorthand specification of formants with default amplitudes and bandwidths, e.g. "formants = c(500, 1500, 2500)" or "formants = list(f1 = 800, f2 = c(1500, 2200))".
  * Support for shorthand specification of all anchors in presets and other input to soundgen_app, e.g. "mouthAnchors = c(0, 0, .3, .5)". The expanded format from soundgen 1.0.0 is also supported.
  * Vectorized rolloff and amplitude modulation parameters, allowing them to change dynamically within a vocalization (command-line only; currently not implemented in the Shiny app).
  * Additional components in tempEffects offering more control over stochastic behavior of soundgen() (command-line only).
  * Separate radiation functions for the lips and the nose (when the mouth is closed). The corresponding soundgen() arguments are "lipRad" (replacing "rolloffLip") and "noseRad".
  * Minor debugging and extended capabilities in soundgen_app(), e.g. preview of formant filter, better intergration of spectrogram and spectrum output plots, a simple way to remove the voiced component, etc.
  * Minor debugging elsewhere, notably dB conversion, timing of unvoiced segments in polysyllabic vocalizations in soundgen(), format of the output in analyzeFolder() and segmentFolder(), etc.

NEW FUNCTIONS:
  * flatEnv(): normalizes amplitude envelope dynamically, i.e., keeping loudness constant throughout the sound
  * estimateVTL(): estimates the length of vocal tract based on formant frequencies
  * fart(): a simplified version of soundgen() for simple and rapid generation of a particular type of sounds, like raspberries, ripping noises, etc
  * beat(): generation of percussive noises like drum-like beats, clicks, etc
