          CHANGES IN SOUNDGEN VERSION 1.1.1 [02-December-2017]
NEW FUNCTIONS:
  * addFormants() for adding or removing formants from an existing sound
  * fade() for adding linear/logarithmic/etc fade-in/out
  * One-click formant picker tool added to soundgen_app()

MINOR:
  * soundgen(): support for discontinuous contours such as pitch jumps, new arguments to soundgen for controlling interpolation between anchors (new arguments: "interpol", "discontThres", "jumpThres")
  * soundgen(): all tempEffects default to 1 and act like scaling factors, a new tempEffect added ("specDep")
  * soundgen(): invalidArgAction propagates through temperature effects, ensuring that "weird" parameter values outside the ranges in permittedValues are processed properly
  * soundgen(): vectorized rolloffNoise
  * soundgen(): slightly modified effects of creakyBreathy hyperparameter
  * soundgen_app(): fixed a bug introduced in soundgen 1.1.0, which caused the app to crash with simplified formant specification
  * Extended and updated vignette on sound generation
  * Miscellaneous small-scale debugging


          CHANGES IN SOUNDGEN VERSION 1.1.0 [19-October-2017]

MAJOR
  * Formant generation is now compatible with standard phonetic models (all-pole or zero-pole models instead of densities of gamma distribution).
  * Unvoiced component is generated with a flat spectrum up to a certain threshold, followed by linear rolloff.
  * An alternative method of synthesizing glottal pulses one by one ("soundgen(glottisAnchors = ...)". Good for vocal fry and, potentially, for integrating alternative models of glottal pulses (future work).
  * Back-compatibility in program syntax is preserved, but presets from version 1.0.0 will sound different. The vignette on sound generation and the preset library are updated accordingly.

MINOR
  * Support for shorthand specification of formants with default amplitudes and bandwidths, e.g. "formants = c(500, 1500, 2500)" or "formants = list(f1 = 800, f2 = c(1500, 2200))".
  * Support for shorthand specification of all anchors in presets and other input to soundgen_app, e.g. "mouthAnchors = c(0, 0, .3, .5)". The expanded format from soundgen 1.0.0 is also supported.
  * Vectorized rolloff and amplitude modulation parameters, allowing them to change dynamically within a vocalization (command-line only; currently not implemented in the Shiny app).
  * Additional components in tempEffects offering more control over stochastic behavior of soundgen() (command-line only).
  * Separate radiation functions for the lips and the nose (when the mouth is closed). The corresponding soundgen() arguments are "lipRad" (replacing "rolloffLip") and "noseRad".
  * Minor debugging and extended capabilities in soundgen_app(), e.g. preview of formant filter, better intergration of spectrogram and spectrum output plots, a simple way to remove the voiced component, etc.
  * Minor debugging elsewhere, notably dB conversion, timing of unvoiced segments in polysyllabic vocalizations in soundgen(), format of the output in analyzeFolder() and segmentFolder(), etc.

NEW FUNCTIONS:
  * flatEnv(): normalizes amplitude envelope dynamically, i.e., keeping loudness constant throughout the sound
  * estimateVTL(): estimates the length of vocal tract based on formant frequencies
  * fart(): a simplified version of soundgen() for simple and rapid generation of a particular type of sounds, like raspberries, ripping noises, etc
  * beat(): generation of percussive noises like drum-like beats, clicks, etc
