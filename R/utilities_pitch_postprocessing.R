### UTILITIES FOR POSTPROCESSING OF PITCH CONTOURS ###

#' Pathfinder
#'
#' Internal soundgen function.
#'
#' Internal helper function for postprocessing pitch contour. Starts with a
#' reasonable guess and computes the more-or-less optimal pitch contour (not
#' quite the very optimal - too computationally expensive).
#' @param pitchCands a matrix of multiple pitch candidates per fft frame. Each
#'   column is one fft frame, each row is one candidate (the last row is always
#'   "manual")
#' @param pitchCert a matrix of the same dimensionality as pitchCands specifying
#'   our certainty in pitch candidates
#' @inheritParams analyze
#' @param interpolWin_bin when interpolating pitch candidates, the median is
#'   calculated over \code{plus-minus interpolWin_bin}
#' @param interpolTol when interpolating pitch candidates, the criterion
#'   for needing to interpolate is the absence of pitch candidates with values
#'   within \code{1 plus-minus interpolTol} of the median of pitch center of
#'   gravity over the interpolation window. For ex., if \code{interpolTol}
#'   is .05, we look for values from 0.95 to 1.05 time the median value over
#'   interpolation window.
#' @param interpolCert when interpolating pitch candidates, all generated pitch
#'   candidates are assigned a certainty equal to \code{interpolCert}
#' @param manualCert the certainty in manually added pitch candidates
#' @return Returns a numeric vector of pitch values representing the best found
#'   path through pitch candidates.
