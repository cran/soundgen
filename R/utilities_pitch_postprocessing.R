### UTILITIES FOR POSTPROCESSING OF PITCH CONTOURS ###

#' Pathfinder
#'
#' Internal soundgen function.
#'
#' Internal helper function for postprocessing pitch contour. Starts with a
#' reasonable guess and computes the more-or-less optimal pitch contour (not
#' quite the very optimal - too computationally expensive).
#' @param pitchCands a matrix of multiple pitch candidates per fft frame. Each
#'   column is one fft frame, each row is one candidate.
#' @param pitchCert a matrix of the same dimensionality as pitchCands specifying
#'   our certainty in pitch candidates
#' @inheritParams analyze
#' @param interpolWin when interpolating pitch candidates, the median is
#'   calculated over \code{± interpolWin}
#' @param interpolTol when interpolating pitch candidates, the criterion
#'   for needing to interpolate is the absence of pitch candidates with values
#'   within \code{1 ± interpolTol} of the median of pitch center of
#'   gravity over the interpolation window. For ex., if \code{interpolTol}
#'   is .05, we look for values from 0.95 to 1.05 time the median value over
#'   interpolation window.
#' @param interpolCert when interpolating pitch candidates, all generated pitch
#'   candidates are assigned a certainty equal to \code{interpolCert}
#' @return Returns a numeric vector of pitch values representing the best found
#'   path through pitch candidates.

#'
#' Internal soundgen function.
#'
#' Internal helper function for smoothing pitch contours or other contours. Only

#' Find voiced segments
#'
#' Internal soundgen function.
#'
#' Internal helper function for postprocessing of pitch contours. Merges voiced
#' segments at least \code{shortestSyl} ms long and separated by less than
#' \code{shortestPause} ms.
#' @param pitchCands matrix of possible pitch values per column. One column is
#'   one fft frame, one row is one pitch candidate
#' @inheritParams analyze
#' @inheritParams spectrogram
#' @param samplingRate sampling rate (Hz)
#' @param minVoicedCands a frame is considered to be voiced if at least this
#'   many pitch candidates are not NA. Defaults to 2: since dom is usually
#'   defined, in practice this means that we also want at least one other pitch
#'   candidate (autocor, cep or BaNa)
