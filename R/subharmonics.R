# Functions for adding subharmonics (vocal fry).

#' Constant subharmonics regime
#'
#' Internal soundgen function.
#'
#' Helper function for adding vocal fry (subharmonics) to a single epoch, with
#' unchanging subharmonics regime (fixed number of subharmonics and sideband
#' width). See master function \code{\link{getVocalFry}}.
#' @param rolloff matrix of original amplitudes of each harmonic in f0 stack
#'   returned by \code{\link{getRolloff}} (columns=time, rows=frequency bins)
#' @param pitch_per_gc vector of the same length as ncol(rolloff)): f0 in Hz,
#'   one value per glottal cycle
#' @param nSubharm the number of subharmonics to generate (a positive integer).
#'   If nSubharm==1, subFreq = f0 / 2. If nSubharm==2, subFreq = f0 / 3 and 2 * f0 / 3.
#'   Etc
#' @param sideband_width_vector (either numeric or vector of the same length as
#'   pitch_per_gc): regulates how quickly the strength of subharmonics fades as
#'   they move away from harmonics in f0 stack. Low values produce narrow
#'   sidebands, high values produce uniformly strong subharmonics
#' @param throwaway01 discard harmonics that are weaker than this number (between
#'   0 and 1) to save computational resources
#' @return Returns a modified rolloff matrix with added subharmonics
