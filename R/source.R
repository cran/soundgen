# Functions for generating excitation source: either noise with generateNoise() or harmonics with generateHarmonics()

#' Generate noise
#'
#' Generates noise of length \code{len} and with spectrum defined by linear
#' decay of \code{rolloffNoise} dB/kHz above \code{noiseFlatSpec} Hz OR by a
#' specified filter \code{filterNoise}. This function is called internally by
#' \code{\link{soundgen}}, but it may be more convenient to call it directly
#' when synthesizing non-biological noises defined by specific spectral and
#' amplitude envelopes rather than formants: the wind, whistles, impact noises,
#' etc. See \code{\link{fart}} and \code{\link{beat}} for similarly simplified
#' functions for voiced non-biological sounds.
#'
#' Algorithm: paints a spectrum with desired characteristics, sets phase to
#' zero, and generates a time sequence via inverse FFT. Noise can then be used
#' as an additional source to be added to the glottal source AFTER the glottal
#' source has been formant-filtered, or BEFORE formant-filtering for glottal
#' breathing noise.
#' @param len length of output
#' @param filterNoise (optional): as an alternative to using rolloffNoise, we
#'   can provide the exact filter - a vector of non-negative numbers specifying
#'   the power in each frequency bin on a linear scale (interpolated to length
#'   equal to windowLength_points/2). A matrix specifying the filter for each
#'   STFT step is also accepted. The easiest way to create this matrix is to
#'   call soundgen:::getSpectralEnvelope, but then you might as well just use
#'   soundgen()
