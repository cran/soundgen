# Functions for generating excitation source: either noise with generateNoise() or harmonics with generateHarmonics()

#' Generate noise
#'
#' Internal soundgen function.
#'
#' Generates white noise of length \code{len} and with spectrum defined by
#' linear decay \code{rolloffNoise} above \code{flatSpectrum} and/or a specified
#' filter \code{filterNoise}. Algorithm: paints a spectrum with desired
#' characteristics, sets phase to zero, and generates a time sequence via
#' inverse FFT. Noise can then be used as an additional source to be added to
#' the glottal source AFTER the glottal source has been formant-filtered, or
#' BEFORE formant-filtering for glottal breathing noise.
#' @param len length of output
#' @param noiseAnchors a dataframe specifying the amplitude envelope of
#'   output. $time: timing of aspiration noise, ms c(start,finish) relative to
#'   voiced part, eg c(-100,500) means breathing starts 100 ms before the voiced
#'   part and lasts until 500 ms into the voiced part (eg total duration of
#'   breathing = 500 - (-100) = 600 ms). noiseAnchors$value: the amount of
#'   aspiration noise at the given time anchors (to be smoothed). throwaway =
#'   no breathing, 0 = as strong as the voiced (harmonic) part
#' @param flatSpectrum keep spectrum flat up to ... Hz (ie rolloffNoise applies
#'   only above this frequency)
#' @inheritParams soundgen
#' @param windowLength_points the length of fft window, points
#' @param filterNoise (optional): in addition to using rolloffNoise,
#'   we can provide the exact filter - a vector of length windowLength_points/2
#'   or, if we want moving formants, a matrix with windowLength_points/2 rows
#'   and an arbitrary number of columns
